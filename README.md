# Adaptive-deprivation-measure

## Aims
The aim of this work is to show how deprivation scales can be implemented much more efficiently in household surveys using insights from psychology and educational research which have led to the development of adaptive measures. These have their basis in Item Response Theory, a foundation shared by deprivation scales. A paper from this work will be available shortly explaining the theoretical basis and illustrating the approach using data from the UK's Family Resources Survey (FRS). 

## Outputs
The work has been presented at a couple of conferences. A journal paper is due for publication shortly (2020). Details will be added here after final acceptance.
